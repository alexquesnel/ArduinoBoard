# ArduinoBoardSound
composed of Alex Q., Matthias Lee Poy-Paxman, Bryan Catudal and team mascot Odell Beckham Jr. 

Project Proposal
Primary Objective: Our first objective is to reproduce the existing sound system in the room. We will need the arduino board to, at 
the push of a button, turn on the audio and play the file "audio on" or turn off the audio and play the file "audio off" 

Secondary Objective: We'd like to be able to increase, decrease or mute the volume straight from the arduino board. 
Using buttons, we will increase the increase the level of decibels (dB) emitted by the speaker connected to the arduino board.
